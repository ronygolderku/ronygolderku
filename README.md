### Short Biography

I am currently a doctorate researcher in the Curtin's Remote Sensing and Satellite Research Group [(RSSRG)](http://rssrg.org/people/students-and-interns.html) under the School of Earth and Planetary science at [Curtin university](https://www.curtin.edu.au/about/learning-teaching/science-engineering/school-of-earth-and-planetary-sciences/), Australia. I did my BSc degree in Fisheries (Honours) from the Fisheries and Marine Resource Technology (FMRT) Discipline at [Khulna University](https://ku.ac.bd/), Bangladesh, in 2018. Later, I completed my MS degree in Coastal and Marine Science (Master's) from the same university in 2020. During my master's thesis, I received the National Science and Technology (NST) fellowship from the [Ministry of Science and Technology](https://most.gov.bd/), Government of Bangladesh. Besides, I was awarded the prestigious DAAD Scholarship to pursue my master's in Marine Biology at the University of Bremen, Germany. I was also the [2nd-place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_gvn1NMbo0) winner at the [Jupyter Notebook Competition](https://www.eumetsat.int/features/new-jupyter-notebook-competition) led by EUMETSAT, a European Agency in charge of operational satellite missions. My research mainly focuses on ocean color remote sensing, coastal zone management, marine ecology, and biological oceanography.
